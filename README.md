# Weather Prediction Models üå¶Ô∏è

## Introduction

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. We use various machine learning models including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset is sourced from the Corgis project and can be found [here](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/weather/weather.csv). It provides various metrics like wind direction, precipitation, and more.

## Models and Evaluation ü§ñ

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Purpose**: Predict the amount of precipitation.
- **Metrics**: MAE, MSE, R^2 Score.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Purpose**: Classify whether it will rain tomorrow.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1 Score.

### 3. Decision Trees
- **Purpose**: Classify whether it will rain tomorrow.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1 Score.

### 4. Logistic Regression
- **Purpose**: Classify whether it will rain tomorrow.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1 Score, Log Loss.
